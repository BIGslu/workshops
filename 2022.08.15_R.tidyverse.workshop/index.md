# Introduction to R and the tidyverse

Welcome! In this 3-session workshop, we use real-world human RNA-seq data to introduce R data manipulation and visualization. Participants will get hands-on experience with coding in R and be introduced to tools in the R tidyverse. You **do not** need any prior experience in R or coding!

## Materials

* [Entire workshop][workshop]

Each lesson

* [0: Setup and installation][lesson0]
* [1: Intro to R and RStudio][lesson1]
* [2: Data manipulation in dplyr and tidyr][lesson2]
* [3: Data visualization in ggplot][lesson3]

## Instructor

[Kim Dill-McFarland, PhD](https://kdillmcfarland.github.io/) is a Senior Bioinformatician in the Div of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the U of Washington. She received her PhD in microbiology from the U of Wisconsin-Madison. Kim now leads a team of bioinformaticians who use sequencing and other high-throughput techniques to research how the human immune system responds to diseases like tuberculosis, asthma, and COVID. Kim has been coding in R for more than 10 years and taught bioinformatics as an Instructor at the U of British Columbia as well as for the Carpentries and RLadies.
