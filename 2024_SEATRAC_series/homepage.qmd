# Introduction

This workshop series is aimed at novice to intermediate R coders. We assume no prior knowledge in Intro to R and then progress from there in subsequent weeks. This series will help prepare those new to R or new to RNAseq data for the SEATRAC Hack Day.

There is 1-1.5 hrs of content per workshop with remaining time dedicated to attendee questions. These questions and associated code will be posted to the GitHub repo after each workshop.
